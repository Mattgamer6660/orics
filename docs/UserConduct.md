# Guidelines.

## Fail Roleplay.

- Breaching anomalys as any FP.
- Camping.
- Cross-Teaming with D-S or DHC.
- Messing with the authorization tablet for no reason.
- Allowing D-S to roam the outpost as a FP.
  - FP are not allowed to use anyone from the subject pool as a "personnal assistant", we tried it before.

## Tool Abuse

- OA's Detain Tool
  - If you have a **VALID** reason to have a FP detained, you can not:
    -  Have them detained for a extended amount of time.
    -  Attempt to bring them into restricted areas.
    -  Roam the outpost with them detained.
  - You are **NOT** allowed to try and kill the person you have detained.
  - You **ARE** allowed to detain someone if they:
    - RK/RT/RS
    - Attempt to cause a breach
    - Continously entering restricted areas
    - Attempting to things they are not allowed to do (i.e SD attempting to experiment with a D-S)
  - If the person you are detaining broke a game rule, you should create a moderation ticket.

## Power Abuse/Power-Tripping

 - As any FP, going on a power trip is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** and will result in you having your data wiped along with getting a 1 month ban.
 - Instances of abusing your power/going on a power-trip include:
   - Forcing other FP to do what you say
   - Toggling alarms for no reason
   - Abusing Project-Torus/Activating Protocol-Clearance when the correct requirements are not met.
   - Creating a site-wide message that has no purpose such as:
     - "Its pizza day! come over to the cafeteria for a slice!"
     - "i like cats :3"
     - "im leaving now see yall later"
   - You are allowed to create messages that have valid purposes, such as:
     - "O-997 has escaped containment, All ERO are to attempt to recontain them"
     - "Testing may now resume, any testing with TL-3 or above anomalys require Directory+ permission."
     - "All personnel are to head to levels above the blast shield, we are activating Project-Torus."
   - Putting and D-S into solitary requires perfect reasoning, examples of these reasons are:
     - The D-S has been rioting. (They must have had to kill at least one person to be considered "rioting"
