# Guidelines.

## Fail Roleplay.

- Breaching anomalys as any FP.
- Camping.
- Cross-Teaming with D-S or RC.
- Messing with the authorization tablet for no reason.
- Allowing D-S to roam the outpost as a FP.
  - FP are not allowed to use anyone from the subject pool as a "personnal assistant", we tried it before.

## Tool Abuse

- OA's Detain Tool
  - If you have a **VALID** reason to have a FP detained, you can not:
    -  Have them detained for a extended amount of time.
    -  Attempt to bring them into restricted areas.
    -  Roam the outpost with them detained.
  - You are **NOT** allowed to try and kill the person you have detained.
  - You **ARE** allowed to detain someone if they:
    - RK/RT/RS
    - Attempt to cause a breach
    - Continously entering restricted areas
    - Attempting to things they are not allowed to do (i.e SD attempting to experiment with a D-S)
  - If the person you are detaining broke a game rule, you should create a moderation ticket.
